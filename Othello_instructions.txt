   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~OTHELLO INSTRUCTIONS:WELCOME!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Othello is a 2-player strategy board game. It is similar to the game "Reversi",
with only slight changes in the rules.
The game board is made up of 8 rows and 8 columns (which are numbered),
i.e., 64 squares.
Each square is denoted by the row and column it resides in (Ex. Square '2 4' is
in 2nd row, 4th column). There are 64 double-sided discs where one face is 
black (also denoted by 'X') and the other is white (denoted by 'O'). 

Othello is a game which takes a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master.

The game can be played in 2 modes:
1. Player VS Player: Play with your friend!
2. Player VS Computer: Challenge the computer!       Next:"Object of the game"

* OBJECT OF THE GAME:
The object of the game is to have the highest number of your colour discs on 
the board at the end of the game.

* STARTING THE GAME:
Each player chooses one colour to use throughout the game (either black or 
white, i.e. 'X' or 'O').  
The game always begins with this setup.

A move consists of "outflanking" your opponent's disc(s), then flipping the 
outflanked disc(s) to your colour. 
To outflank means to place a disc on the board such that your opponent's 
row(s), column(s) or diagonal(s) is bordered at each end by a disc of your 
colour.                                              Next:"How to play"

* HOW TO PLAY:

1. Black (X) always moves first. Then white (O) and so on alternatively.
2. On your turn, the current status of the game board will be displayed using
   which you can decide on your move. Once move is played, updated board 
   will also be displayed.
3. Enter your move in the format "row column", where row = row in which square 
   lies, column = similarly.
2. If on your turn you are unable to flip even one of the opponent's discs, you
   cannot place any moves and you miss your turn. The play then goes to your 
   oppenent.
3. You cannot forfeit your turn if you have moves available and must play your 
   turn.
4. A disc may outflank any number of discs in one move in any number of 
   directions (i.e. as row, column or diagonal). Ex:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8         1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
1 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 1     1 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 1   - With one move  
2 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 2     2 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 2     discs of row,      
3 -  -  O  -  -  -  O  - 3     3 -  -  O  -  -  -  O  - 3     column and    
4 -  -  X  -  -  X  -  - 4     4 -  -  O  -  -  O  -  - 4     diagonal were 
5 -  -  X  -  X  -  -  - 5     5 -  -  O  -  O  -  -  - 5     flipped.
6 -  -  X  X  -  -  -  - 6     6 -  -  O  O  -  -  -  - 6
7 -  -  -  X  O  -  -  - 7     7 -  -  O  O  O  -  -  - 7
8 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 8     8 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 8
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8         1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 
  
5. You cannot skip your own colour disc to outflank the opponent's disc.
   Ex:
 
      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8         
    1 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 1     - 'X' disc placed at 
    2 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 2        (7,1) turns only 1
    3 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 3        white disc (7,2)
    4 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 4        and does not flip 
    5 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 5        the discs at (7,4)
    6 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 6        and (7,5).
    7 -  O  X  O  O  X  -  - 7     
    8 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 8     
      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8        
  
6. All discs outflanked in any one move will be flipped, even if it is to the 
   player's advantage not to flip them all. 
7. A disc once placed on the board can never be moved again during the 
   remainder of the game.

* ENDING OF THE GAME:
When none of the players have anymore moves, the game ends. The number of discs
for each player is counted and the player with the highest number of discs wins
the game.
