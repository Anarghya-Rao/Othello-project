About Othello, the game:
- Othello is a 2-player strategy board game. The board is an 8x8 board, i.e., has 8 rows and 8 columns 
and so consists of 64 squares. The game also comes with 64 two-colour sided (black and white) discs 
(or “coins”), 32 discs for each player. Each player picks one of the colours and uses that for the 
remainder of the game.
- The game is played turn-wise and every move is an attempt to outflank the opponent’s discs and thus 
flip them to face our colour. “Outflanking” means to place a disc such that the player’s discs are on 
both ends of a row, column or diagonal of the opponent’s discs. These can then be flipped to face our 
colour.
- The aim of the game is to have higher number of discs of your colour on the board than your 
opponent at the end of the game.
